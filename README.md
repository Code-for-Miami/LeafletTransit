# LeafletTransit

## What

This is a LeafletJS-based prototype of a real time map for various transit systems, including Miami-Dade Transit and various trolley services. Goal: Can you go to one website and see where your bus is or where the citibikes are or where to get off for the landmarks like the American Airlines Arena, etc?

Reload the site often for the latest data to show. (Can use Shift + Reload button for full page refresh)
